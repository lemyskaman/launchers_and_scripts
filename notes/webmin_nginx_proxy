Unfortunately there is not much information on how to proxy webmin properly with nginx.
This is my config on centos 7, it works with any theme without errors.
In /etc/webmin/config make sure relative_redir=0 or it will give you the problems @PhilPhonic and @mobamoba mentioned before.

referer=www.examle.com
webprefix=/webmin
webprefixnoredir=1
relative_redir=0
In /etc/miniserv.conf

trust_real_ip=1
ssl=0
cookiepath=/webmin
(trust_real_ip=1 is to show the correct ip in recent logins)
If nginx is on the same host as webmin you can make it listen only on loopback with this in miniserv.conf:

bind=127.0.0.1
Your location block should look like this, nothing more.
With proxy_set_header Host $host; you'll get the login redirect problem!

location /webmin/ { 
	proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
	proxy_pass http://localhost:10000/;
} 
Make sure you don't have something like this in your server block or the pages will be missing style.

location ~* \.(js|css|ico|png|jpg|jpeg|gif)$ {
	expires max;
	add_header Cache-Control public;
	log_not_found off;
}
Clear you browser cache, restart nginx and webmin.
Hope it helps.

thank you so much for this. I tried all of the various guides out there, but this is the only one that worked. This needs to be followed exactly as it is written or it won't work.
